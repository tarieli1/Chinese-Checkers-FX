The Main class is 'src.chinesecheckersfx.ChineseCheckersFX.java'

Some assumption we made:

1) First click on 'Save' or 'SaveAs' will prompt a FileChooser, Later only 'SaveAs' 
   click will be promting a File Chooser(Even on a new game).

2) Pressing the 'Quit' button will remove current human player,
   When pressing the 'Quit' button while game is over, game will exit.

3) Game will be over if all Human Player Quited.

Some notes:

1) Computer has good AI will always try to move to best point.
